        "\n",
        "As you have experienced, training even a small-sized BERT model can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we explore **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods, which allow us to utilize the power of large pretrained models without requiring extensive resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**\n",
        "\n",
        "PEFT methods focus on fine-tuning only a small portion of the model’s parameters while keeping most of the pretrained weights frozen. This drastically reduces the computational and storage requirements while leveraging the rich knowledge embedded in pretrained models.\n",
        "\n",
        "One popular PEFT method is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What is LoRA?**\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRA introduces a mechanism to fine-tune large language models by injecting small low-rank matrices into the model's architecture. Instead of updating all parameters during training, LoRA trains these small matrices while keeping the majority of the original parameters frozen.  This is achieved as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Frozen Weights**: The pretrained weights of the model, represented as a weight matrix $ W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k} $, remain **frozen** during fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Low-Rank Decomposition**:\n",
        "   Instead of directly updating $ W $, LoRA introduces two trainable matrices, $ A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r} $ and $ B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times k} $, where $ r \\ll \\min(d, k) $.  \n",
        "   These matrices approximate the update to $ W $ as:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\Delta W = A \\cdot B\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, $ r $, the rank of the decomposition, is a key hyperparameter that determines the trade-off between computational cost and model capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adaptation**:\n",
        "   During training, instead of updating $ W $, the adapted weight is:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   W' = W + \\Delta W = W + A \\cdot B\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   Only the low-rank matrices $ A $ and $ B $ are optimized, while $ W $ remains fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficiency**:\n",
        "   Since $ r $ is much smaller than $ d $ and $ k $, the number of trainable parameters in $ A $ and $ B $ is significantly less than in $ W $. This makes the approach highly efficient both in terms of computation and memory.\n",
